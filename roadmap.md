## üéØ Current Focus: Phase 2 - TUI Redesign

The immediate goal is to simplify the TUI, fix navigation issues, and create a clean, intuitive interface that serves as the foundation for the web dashboard in Phase 3.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Simplicity**: Remove complexity that doesn't serve the core workflow
2. **Clarity**: Always show where you are and what project you're working on
3. **Consistency**: Same navigation patterns across all views
4. **Focus**: One clear action per view, no cognitive overload
